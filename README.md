# roam2json
Strongly Based on Mark Lavercombes Roam Depot extension at https://github.com/mlava/json-webhooks
Combines all child blocks into single string, converts to html, and in my use case sends to Konnectzit, but could also be Zapier
Then sent via email to Wordpress Blog (Postie plugin) or could also be used to send an email to someone
